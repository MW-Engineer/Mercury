<h1>Mercury Testbed - A work in-progress</h1>

<h2>Intro:</h2>
A brief attempt to establish a simulated testbed.

Also serving to cover basic C++ skills and techniques 

This would include infrastructure: (In progress)
<ul>
<li>Sensors - a input mechanism</li>
<li>Channel - a output mechanism </li>
<li>Platform - a grouping of hardware</li>
<li>Manager - to prevent erroneous hardware assignment</li>
</ul>
This would include an application to test: (In progress)

This would include an Interface between the application and the infrastructure: (In progress)

This would include a Testbed to view the output and view the input : (In progress)
<ul>
<li>User interaction</li>
<li>User visualization</li>
</ul>
