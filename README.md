Intro:
Simulated redundant sensor fail over w/ testbed

This consists of three distinct components
	1. Testbed
	2. Infrastructure
	3. Application
	
-Testbed contains staging and configuration of the virtual infrastructure and application

-Infrastructure is the virtual representation of the external input (hw sensors, external input, infrastructure) 

-Application consists of the  the software modules reading the infrastructure layer, sensor abstration logic, and any addtional algorithm processing
